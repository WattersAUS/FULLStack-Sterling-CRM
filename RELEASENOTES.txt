This file can be expanded (into another dir for eg) and all links etc should work)

Updates:

1. Have changed all pages (that require it) to php extension and included the nav bar into the pages.

2. Tidied the directory structure all pages now sit at the root of the folder structure

3. Tidied the includes file css/js and php into more logical folders structure

4. Removed duplicate files from the structure (angular etc)

5. Removed the need for an app.js file, all js controllers now declare the app controller
    (means we don't need to mod a file that can break other pages)

6. Reinstated the old material design lib to fix the broken dialogs until we can code around the problem with dropdowns

7. Linked pages to the index.php and admin.php pages so links work
    (it looks more like a site now)

8. Working Job list page
    a. accepts creates job via dialog when 'Create' is selected
    b. detail changed (now shows cust ref no, job description in row)

9. Reformatted some of the source files
    (general code tidy)

10. Changed 'myApp' controller to individual controller declared for each page

Issues:

1. Need to recode dialogs as scroll bars not currently working (there is a incompatibility between the material lib and another of the included js files)

2. Employee maint doesn't fully work (display does)

3. On Job display the detail line "Job Details- / /" will occasionally be displayed
    (I think it's a timing issue on the data load against the form display, refresh and data is displayed correctly)

4. ID between is passed via ngStorage local storage
    (needs to be changed to session handling)

5. Needs some validation on fields sizes etc so we don't make trips to server we don't need!

6. Need to include the login/customer forms yet

7. Font sizes on the pages needs to be looked at (particularly the admin pages)
