Updates: DDL Updates for shuffling old statuses and introducing new ones

1. DDL - job_status

ALTER TABLE job_status MODIFY description VARCHAR(64);

2. SQL - job_status (introduce new statuses and reorder 'Completed' statuses)

INSERT INTO job_status (description, template_page, manual_action) SELECT description, template_page, manual_action FROM job_status WHERE id = 11;
INSERT INTO job_status (description, template_page, manual_action) SELECT description, template_page, manual_action FROM job_status WHERE id = 12;

UPDATE job_status SET description = 'Job Completed-Awaiting Job Sheet', template_page = 'awaitJobSheetJobDisplay', manual_action = 1 WHERE id = 10;
UPDATE job_status SET description = 'Job Completed-Further Work Required', template_page = 'furtherWorkReqJobDisplay', manual_action = 1 WHERE id = 11;
UPDATE job_status SET description = 'Job Completed-Please INVOICE', template_page = 'completedJobDisplay', manual_action = 1 WHERE id = 12;

3. SQL - job / job_status data update (need to disable TRIGGERS to ensure data updates do not spawn job_history recs)

DROP TRIGGER update_job;

UPDATE job_history SET status_id = 14 WHERE status_id = 12;
UPDATE job_history SET status_id = 13 WHERE status_id = 11;

UPDATE job SET status_id = 14 WHERE status_id = 12;
UPDATE job SET status_id = 13 WHERE status_id = 11;

4. DDL - reinstate job TRIGGERS

DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER update_job AFTER UPDATE ON job
 FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
 INSERT INTO job_history (
   job_id,
   site_id,
   employee_id,
   status_id,
   status_change,
   customer_ref_no,
   site_contact_id,
   description,
   closed
 ) VALUES (
   NEW.id,
   NEW.site_id,
   NEW.employee_id,
   NEW.status_id,
   NEW.status_change,
   NEW.customer_ref_no,
   NEW.site_contact_id,
   NEW.description,
   NEW.closed
 );
     END
//
DELIMITER ;

    b) No Job Sheet
    c) Further Work Required

Issues:

20/06/2017
==========

Updates:

1. Have changed all pages (that require it) to php extension and included the nav bar into the pages.

2. Tidied the directory structure all pages now sit at the root of the folder structure

3. Tidied the includes file css/js and php into more logical folders structure

4. Removed duplicate files from the structure (angular etc)

5. Removed the need for an app.js file, all js controllers now declare the app controller
    (means we don't need to mod a file that can break other pages)

6. Reinstated the old material design lib to fix the broken dialogs until we can code around the problem with dropdowns

7. Linked pages to the index.php and admin.php pages so links work
    (it looks more like a site now)

8. Working Job list page
    a. accepts creates job via dialog when 'Create' is selected
    b. detail changed (now shows cust ref no, job description in row)

9. Reformatted some of the source files
    (general code tidy)

10. Changed 'myApp' controller to individual controller declared for each page

Issues:

1. Need to recode dialogs as scroll bars not currently working (there is a incompatibility between the material lib and another of the included js files)

2. Employee maint doesn't fully work (display does)

3. On Job display the detail line "Job Details- / /" will occasionally be displayed
    (I think it's a timing issue on the data load against the form display, refresh and data is displayed correctly)

4. ID between is passed via ngStorage local storage
    (needs to be changed to session handling)

5. Needs some validation on fields sizes etc so we don't make trips to server we don't need!

6. Need to include the login/customer forms yet

7. Font sizes on the pages needs to be looked at (particularly the admin pages)
